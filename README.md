# What does `Component Framework` means?
`DDD Light` is based on multiple patterns, models and ideas, inluding: `DDD`, `CQRS`, `EDA`, `SOA`, `ROP`, `DAL` and so on.

But the main idea of `DDD Light` is to give you **abillity to use those concepts separately**:

- Уou need just `Repository`? Take `@dddl/dal` package.
- You want to include `CQRS`? Just implement `@dddl/cqrs` package and that's all.
- Want power of `Event Driven Architecture`? `@dddl/eda` comes to rescue.
- etc.

There is no need to take whole `DDD` to your project if you need just a part of it.

This gives you opportunity to include this libraries in existing project concept by concept (package by package).
